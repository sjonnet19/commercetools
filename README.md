# Commercetools JavaScript Training Excercises

This repo contains exercises for the [commercetools JS SDK](https://github.com/commercetools/nodejs) training.

The exercises are intended to run in node.js 8 on your local machine. 

The participants should finish following exercises:
- Configure and create client
- Get project info
- Query all product types
- Query all tax categories
- Create a product
- Query products
- Search products
- Create a customer
- Create a cart
- Query a cart by id
- Update cart
- Create an order from cart
- Delete cart

The `exercise*.js` scripts are typically not modified, the task is to implement the modules in `handson/` until the `exercise*.js` scripts show the intended behavior. 

These exercises complement a training program, they do not intend to help understanding commercetools by themselves.
